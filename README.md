SupervisedLearning
==================

CS 4641 Machine Learning Assignment 1. This project implements 5 popular supervised learning techniques: 
Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Boosting, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machines

It provides an in depth analysis of resulting accuracy and confusion of each algorithm and offers conjecture 
as to the resulting performance of each algorithm.
